/*
  This template guides the creation of post-deployment scripts, typically used for seeding reference data or similar tasks. 
  While these scripts are usually idempotent, you can configure them for single or repeated execution through 'pgup.json'.

  Place scripts in the post-deployment directory, ensuring they are named for easy identification and ordered as needed.

  Update 'pgup.json' to manage how and when these scripts are run.
